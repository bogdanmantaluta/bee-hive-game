I've also hosted it here on Github Pages for easy testing:
https://bogdanmantaluta.github.io/bee-hive-game/src/index.html

If you want to start it locally:
1. npm install.
2. start using the "start" script from package.json. ( should help with the CORS errors )
3. navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4200/src/ ( you can find the exact route in the terminal after starting http-server )
4. to run tests with code coverage run the "test" script.
